# Feature Demo: Like and Dislike Button for Responses

## Description
Allows users to provide feedback on each assistant response using 👍 (like) and 👎 (dislike) buttons. This helps the system understand user preferences and response quality.

## How to Use
1. After the assistant responds, you will see 👍 and 👎 buttons below each response.
2. Click 👍 if you found the response helpful, or 👎 if not.
3. The UI will acknowledge your feedback and, if you click 👎, offer the option to generate a new answer.

## Location in Code
- `src/ui/text_chat.py` (search for `like` or `dislike`)
